2. FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF GENERATIVE AI 

2.1 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a class of AI systems that can create new content such as:

* Text
* Images
* Audio
* Video
* Code
* 3D models

2.2 Core Concepts Behind Generative AI

(a). Data Learning

Generative AI learns patterns from large datasets.

Example:

* Text models learn grammar, facts, and structure from billions of words.

* Image models learn shapes, textures, and styles from millions of images.

(b). Probability Modeling

It predicts the probability of the next element.

Example in text:

> “AI is transforming the __”
The model predicts the most probable next word (e.g., "world", "industry", etc.)

(c). Neural Networks

Most generative systems use deep neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns.

(d). Latent Space Representation

Generative models compress data into a lower-dimensional mathematical representation called latent space.

Input Data → Encoder → Latent Space → Decoder → Generated Output



3. GENERATIVE MODELS AND THEIR TYPES

3.1 What is a Generative Model?

A generative model learns the joint probability distribution of data and can generate new samples from it.

Example:
> “What does real data look like?”

3.2 Types of Generative Models

(a). Autoregressive Models

Generate data one step at a time.

Example: GPT models


Flow:

Word1 → Word2 → Word3 → Word4 → ...

Advantages:

High-quality text generation
Disadvantages:

Slow (sequential generation)

(b). Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

Structure:

Input → Encoder → Latent Distribution → Decoder → Output

Used in:

Image generation

Data compression


Advantages:

Smooth latent space Disadvantages:

Sometimes blurry outputs

(c). Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Two networks compete:

Generator → Creates Fake Data
Discriminator → Detects Real vs Fake

Training Process:

Generator → Fake Image
Discriminator → Real or Fake?
Feedback → Improve Generator

Used in:

Deepfakes

Photorealistic images

(d). Diffusion Models

Used in:

* DALL·E
* Stable Diffusion
* Midjourney

Process:

Image → Add Noise → Train Model to Remove Noise → Generate Clean Image

Advantages:

* High-quality image generation
* Stable training


(e). Transformer-Based Models

Foundation of modern LLMs.

Key concept: Self-Attention Mechanism

Allows the model to understand relationships between all words in a sentence simultaneously.

4. 2024 AI TOOLS

5. What is an LLM?

5.1 Definition

LLM (Large Language Model) is a deep learning model trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like language.

Examples:

* GPT-4
* Gemini
* Claude
* LLaMA

5.2 Why “Large”?

Because:

* Billions or trillions of parameters
* Trained on terabytes of text data
* Requires massive computing power (GPUs/TPUs)


6. HOW AN LLM IS BUILT

Step 1: Data Collection

Sources:

* Books
* Websites
* Research papers
* Code repositories

Step 2: Data Cleaning

* Remove duplicates
* Remove harmful content
* Filter low-quality data

Step 3: Tokenization

Text is converted into tokens:

“Artificial Intelligence”
→ ["Artificial", "Intelligence"]
→ Token IDs

Step 4: Model Architecture (Transformer)

Core Components:

* Embedding Layer

* Self-Attention Layers

* Feedforward Networks

* Layer Normalization

* Output Softmax


Self-Attention Example:

Word A attends to Word B
Word B attends to Word C
All words attend to each other

Step 5: Pre-training

Objective: Predict next word

Example:

Input: AI is the future of
Target: technology

Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss

Step 6: Fine-Tuning

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)


This makes the model:

* Safer

* More aligned

* More helpful
